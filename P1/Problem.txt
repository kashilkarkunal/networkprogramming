1. Consider a parent process P which takes L on command-line and creates three
processes C1,C2, and C3.
2. C1 sends a signal SIGUSR1 to C2 after every 3 seconds.
3. C2 sends a signal SIGUSR2 to C3 after every 6 seconds.
4. C3 sends a signal SIGUSR1 to C1 after every 9 seconds.
5. Every time any child receives a signal it sends SIGINT to parent P and the child
prints its pid and the signal number received. P counts the number of signals
received. When number of signals equal L, parent sends SIGTERM to C1. When
number of signals equal L+3, parent sends SIGTERM to C2. When number of
signals equal L+6, parent sends SIGTERM to C3.
6. When SIGTERM is received, child exits.
